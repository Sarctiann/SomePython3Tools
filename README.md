**Some tools to practice Python3**

This repository contains a code of practice. It might be useful for those of you just starting out with Python3:

+ 🐍 [DinamicPython](https://github.com/Sarctiann/SomePython3Tools/tree/main/DinamicPython) : A small Python editor for testing scripts and saving them and their outputs.

+ 🖼️ [GUIs](https://github.com/Sarctiann/SomePython3Tools/tree/main/GUIs) : Two hands-on GUI tkinter examples and a basic Turtle demo.

+ 🐮 [GuessTheAnimal](https://github.com/Sarctiann/SomePython3Tools/tree/main/GuessTheAnimal) : A nice program learned from a book thats implement a binary tree.

+ 💻 [clTools](https://github.com/Sarctiann/SomePython3Tools/tree/main/clTools) : Three command-line tools. One to order dictionaries, another to operate with percentages and another to compare cars (second-hand cars :man_shrugging:)

+ Finally 🧮 [tkTools](https://github.com/Sarctiann/SomePython3Tools/tree/main/tkTools) : Two scripts but only one tool really. A metaclass for instantiating tekinter widgwts.

> **NO MORE:** Comments are in Spanish. When I started programming, I didn't want to confuse keywords with arbitrary words, so commenting in my native language helped. Maybe add the english comments later.

All scripts were translated to **English**

:ear: I hear proposals to write new scripts from my current experience, to add here. :blue_heart: I will always be grateful for the large number of people who share their knowledge. And I think it would be a good way to return what I received!

> Some scripts have the extension .pyw. That is for Windows to run as GUIs (with pythonw.exe instead of python.exe) I'm using linux but I keep the habit.
